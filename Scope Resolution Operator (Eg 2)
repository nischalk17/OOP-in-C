/* Scope resolution operator is (::) is also used to define a function outside the class.
Let us declare two functions user1 and user2 inside the class named user.
Since user1 and user2 are the member functions of the class user, we need to use 
scope resolution operator to define the function outside the class as follows:  */

void user::user2()      //accessing second member function by using ::

This is User 1
This is User 2
